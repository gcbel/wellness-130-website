            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Wellness 130 Alumni website!</p>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, taking a few minutes to meditate can make a big difference in our mental and emotional health.</p>
            <p>This website keeps track of the meditation practices we covered each week and links some meditation recordings you can revisit. I invite you to explore this website and let it help you in your continued practice. I wish all of you the best!</p>
            <h4>Motivation for this site</h4>
            <p>Meditation has become an important part of my week, and offers profound benefits that extend far beyond moments of tranquility. It serves as a cornerstone of emotional well-being and helps to bring balance and mindfulness to life's challenges.</p>
            <p>This course reinforced the importance of cultivating mindfulness and compassion in our daily lives, inspiring me to create a platform where individuals can continue to access resources beyond the duration of the class. Meditation has been shown to equip individuals with invaluable tools for self-reflection and emotional resilience. Having begun to witness these changes myself, I am hopeful that this site will help myself and others keep up with practice beyond this course.</p>
            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>Personally, I thrived the most in this course during weeks 3 and 5, during the body scan meditation and the gratitude meditation, respectively. I found these meditations to be useful in drawing the mind from everything around me, which allowed me to more deeply engage in the practice.</p>
            <p>I loved the community created in this class, and found that it truly added to the feeling of stepping into a calm space at the end of a busy day.</p>
            <p>I initially took this course not knowing anything about meditation, and have been fully convinced by these ten weeks to work to integrate it into my life. I hope to bring with me a sense of gratitude for all I have and an emotional resilience that helps carry me through challenging moments.</p>
            <p>Thank you, Rebecca, for the loving way in which you have brought all of us into the world of meditation, you have been a wonderful teacher.</p>
